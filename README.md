## Foundations of Computer Science

This fundamental knowledge of how computers and programming languages work will allow you to optimize and debug everything that comes your way in the future of your career. You will also begin to work with algorithms and data structures that are fundamental building blocks for great Software Developers - the kind of professional that top companies hire.

In the first fundamentals module, you'll work on C and Unix programming, graphical programming, data structures, assembly language and algorithms, as well as reverse engineering and security protocols.

From there, you will be introduced to higher-level languages, increasingly advanced algorithms, space and time complexity, database management and front-end programming. Using the latest technologies, you will begin to create a complete web application project that encompasses the rest of the core modules.

The final fundamentals module emphasizes automation, scalability and reliability, so you will be familiar with the infrastructure and best practices similar to those applied in large technology companies. In parallel to web development, you will also advance in algorithmic understanding, technical writing, debugging and project management.
